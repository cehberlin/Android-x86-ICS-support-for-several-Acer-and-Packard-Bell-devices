This patch adds a feature of an automatic detection of available hardware keyboards and selection of their layouts.

If hardware keyboards are available a new setting for the hardware keyboard layout selection will be shown in settings app.

This patch comes with additional hardware keyboard layouts for German, French and Russian keyboards.

The layouts in /device/common/keymaps should be removed because they are not working with ICS and left over from gingerbread/froyo releases.
