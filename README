Device target for Android-x86. Especially for below listed devices
 
Tested on:
- Acer 1825PT
- Acer 1825PTZ
- Acer 1820PT
- Acer 1810 *
- Acer 1425
- Acer 1420
- Acer 1410 *
- Packard Bell Butterfly

* (full speed after disk installation, because it is necessary to disable the sensors lib to avoid 
    polling sensors library without sensor)


Credits to all users who are helping to test!

Supports:
- Multitouch Touchscreen and Touchpad
- Sound and at least external microphone
- Wifi
- Bluetooth
- SD-Cardreader
- Webcam
- Accelerometer --> auto-rotation 
    (if available, if not sensors library will be disabled automatically after second boot in non-livemode 
        (installed on any disk) --> reduces cpu load)
- Selection of different hardware keyboard layouts --> German, English, French and Russian
- Backlight
- Automatic detection of tablet and laptop mode on convertible devices via TABLET_SW command 
    --> Results in hiding automatically the onscreen keyboard


Should also work well on other devices from Acer (or Packard Bell clones), let me know if you have tested it!
    - Also Intel Atom based devices


Virtualbox support with:
- Working Ethernet
- No HW-acceleration


Check http://www.ceh-photo.de for further information and support!


Development information:
- You need to add Google Apps on your own, because of licence difficulties:
    - Just copy all files from your gapps package in corresponding structure below 
        folder gapps-ics and enable commented  PRODUCT_COPY_FILES lines in aspire1000s.mk
    - Only enable "remove unnecessary apps patch" if you integrate Google Apps
- The default ICS-kernel 3.09 must be replaced with the android kernel from 
    gingerbread 2.6.39 (because of problems with suspend and wifi). You need to include the 
    hid-multitouch backport from 3.09, Ethernet patch and acer-hdf patch for better support of 
    above Acer devices with. All these changes are integrated in kernel_2.6.39_patch
- To apply all changes to a fresh Android-x86 ICS checkout, you need to:
    - copy the checked out repo directory to /devices directory inside your ICS-x86 checkout 
    - replace the kernel directory with the checked out directory from gingerbread-x86 and 
    - apply above mentioned kernel patch
    - copy every patch directory content of patches you want to apply to repo base directory 
      (creates all new files) and apply patches/diffs for changing existing files
